<p id ="aboutme">
My name is Mark Zuckerberg, and I was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. I am the son of dentist Edward I and psychiatrist Karen Kempner. My three sisters, Randi, Donna, Arielle and I, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. I was raised Jewish and I had my bar mitzvah when I turned 13. Afterward, I became an atheist. Although a sworn atheist, I have a firm belief in karma and has previously stated that Buddhism as a religion is amazing.

At Ardsley High School, I excelled in classes. I transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire in his junior year, where I won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. On his college application, I claimed that I can read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. I was captain of the fencing team.</p>

<p id="aboutme">
By the time I began classes at Harvard, I had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy", notes Vargas. I studied psychology and computer science as well as belonging to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year, I wrote a program I called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, I created a different program I initially called Facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to my roommate at the time, Arie Hasit, "I built the site for fun". Hasit explains:

We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, I built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.

The site went up over a weekend; but by Monday morning, the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. I apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."

The following semester, in January 2004, I began writing code for a new website. On February 4, 2004, I launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused I of intentionally misleading them into believing I would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while I was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. The three complained to the Harvard Crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in response.

Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against I that resulted in a settlement. The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares that were worth US$300 million at Facebook's IPO.

I dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project. In January 2014, I recalled:

I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more. </p>
